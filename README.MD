## Portfolio

I’m Faruk Ateş, and this is the start of my [portfolio website](http://portfolio.farukat.es/), focusing on Product Design and Development.

The current planned contents for this portfolio are the following case studies:

### Case study: Presentate
[Presentate](https://presentate.com/), the product [my co-founder](https://medium.com/minds-behind-dropbox-paper/the-future-of-collaborative-tools-9ba504d5faff) and I created in 2012–13, is a web-based presentation software and sharing platform. It espoused a view that current presentation software focuses users on the wrong things, encouraging bad practices that waste time and lead to nervous presenters, poor audience experiences, and the dreaded _Death by PowerPoint_.

### Case study: Modernizr
Created and launched in 2009, Modernizr changed the face of the web industry by empowering designers and developers with control over the user experience when using cutting-edge features being added in CSS3 and HTML5. Modernizr has since become [a popular community effort](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) on GitHub, with more than 200 contributors, over 20,000 stars, and [two Open Source App of the Year awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernizr#Overview).

### Case study: A human-centric Twitter
Twitter suffers from phony bot accounts, spam, abuse & harassment, and fake news. What if those problems could be reduced, perhaps even solved, without imposing moderating and censorship? What if Twitter was designed to put people first?

### Case study: An email client for the future
Between Inbox 5000 and declaring email bankruptcy, our mail clients are consistently poor at actually helping us manage email overload and sorting through the mess to get emails we actually need. Every time a new mail client announces itself I am (briefly) hopeful someone is thinking more holistically about this problem, but each time I am disappointed.

### Case study: Onboarding in space flight sims
This is an unusual one: I’m writing a science fiction short story that doubles as an example for how space flight simulator games like _Elite: Dangerous_, _Star Citizen_ or _No Man’s Sky_ could onboard new players. It triples as a product design case study, applied to video game design, also highlighting the relevancy of cross-disciplined thinking in this field.

### Case study…sorta: The Writer’s Journey
[I’m writing a science fiction novel](http://farukat.es/journal/2017/02/717-im-writing-sci-fi-novel/), not just short stories, and I’m product designing my entire approach to writing this novel. As I’m doing so, I’m also documenting the process I’m going through as a first-time novelist, to hopefully help (future) first-timers figure out how to tackle such a project.
